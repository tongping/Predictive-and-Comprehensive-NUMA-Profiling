Parallel applications are extremely challenging to achieve the optimal performance on the NUMA architecture,  which necessitates the assistance of profiling tools. However, existing NUMA-profiling tools share some similar shortcomings, such as portability, effectiveness, and helpfulness issues. This paper proposes a novel profiling tool--\NP{}--that overcomes these issues.  \NP{} aims to identify potential performance issues for any NUMA architecture, instead of only on the current hardware. To achieve this, \NP{} focuses on memory sharing patterns between threads, instead of real remote accesses. \NP{} further detects potential thread migrations and load imbalance issues that could significantly affect the performance but are omitted by existing profilers. \NP{} also separates cache coherence issues that may require different fix strategies. Based on our extensive evaluation, \NP{} is able to identify more performance issues than any existing tool, while fixing these bugs leads to up to $5.94\times$ performance speedup.
