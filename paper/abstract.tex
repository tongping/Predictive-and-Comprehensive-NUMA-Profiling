\begin{abstract}
We are planning to work on a NUMA performance detector--\NP{}. Different from existing allocators, \NP{} focuses on memory sharing pattern, and identify objects that have a large number of accesses from different threads. The difference is that the detection results are not relied on the current hardware topology, which can find potential performance issues for any topology. This will avoid the endless detection on different hardware.

We will compute the potential performance issue during the offline diagnosis, while only those shared ones will be identified.
