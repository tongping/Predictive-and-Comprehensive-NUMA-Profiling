Parallel applications are extremely challenging to achieve their optimal performance on the NUMA architecture,  due to remote accesses and load imbalance issues, which necessitates the assistance of profiling tools. However, existing NUMA-profiling tools share some similar shortcomings, such as portability, effectiveness, and helpfulness issues. This paper proposes a novel profiling tool--\NP{}--that overcomes these issues.  \NP{} aims to identify all potential performance issues for any NUMA architecture, instead of only on the current hardware. To achieve this, \NP{} focuses on memory sharing patterns between threads, instead of real remote accesses. \NP{} further detects potential thread migrations and load imbalance issues that could significantly affect the performance but are omitted by existing profilers. \NP{} further differentiates false sharing from true sharing, providing more information to guide bug fixes. Based on our extensive evaluation, \NP{} is able to identify multiple times of performance issues than existing tools, while fixing these bugs leads to up to $4.4\times$ performance speedup on widely-used applications.
