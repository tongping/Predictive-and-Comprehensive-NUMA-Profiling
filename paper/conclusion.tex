\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Parallel applications running on NUMA machines are prone to different types of performance issues. Existing NUMA profilers may miss significant portion of optimization opportunities. Further, they are bound to a specific NUMA topology. Different from them, \NP{} proposes an architecture-independent  and scheduling-independent method that could detect NUMA issues even without running on a NUMA machine. Comparing to existing NUMA profilers, \NP{} detects more performance issues without false alarms, and also provides more helpful information to assist bug fixes. In summary, \NP{} will be an indispensable tool that could identify NUMA issues in development phases.
